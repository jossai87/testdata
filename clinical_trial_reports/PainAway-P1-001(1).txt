Clinical Trial Report: PainAway-P1-001

1. Executive Summary:
The Phase 1 trial of PainAway, a novel selective sodium channel blocker, has been completed. This first-in-human study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of PainAway in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic neuropathic pain. The results demonstrate a favorable safety profile and encouraging signs of analgesic activity, supporting further development.

2. Trial Design:
- Study type: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose
- Duration: May 1, 2022 - April 30, 2023
- Participants: 100 total (80 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy)
- Dosage: Single doses (10, 25, 50, 100, 200mg) and multiple doses (25, 50, 100mg BID for 7 days)
- Primary endpoints: Safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic parameters
- Secondary endpoints: Changes in pain scores in patient cohort, QST in healthy volunteers

3. Safety and Tolerability Results:
- Most common adverse events:
  * Dizziness (12%)
  * Headache (9%)
  * Nausea (7%)
  * Somnolence (5%)
- All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity
- No serious adverse events reported
- No clinically significant changes in ECG, vital signs, or laboratory parameters

4. Pharmacokinetics:
- Rapid absorption (Tmax 1-2 hours)
- Dose-proportional increase in exposure
- Terminal half-life: approximately 12 hours
- Steady-state achieved within 3 days of BID dosing
- No significant food effect observed

5. Pharmacodynamics:
- Dose-dependent increase in pain threshold and tolerance in healthy volunteers (QST)
- Significant reduction in spontaneous pain scores in patient cohort at 100mg BID (p<0.05 vs placebo)

6. Preliminary Efficacy (Patient Cohort):
- Mean change in average daily pain score (0-10 NRS) at day 7:
  * 100mg BID: -2.1
  * Placebo: -0.8
  (p=0.03)
- 50% responder rate:
  * 100mg BID: 40%
  * Placebo: 10%
  (p=0.04)

7. Conclusions:
PainAway demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this Phase 1 study. The pharmacokinetic profile supports twice-daily dosing. Preliminary efficacy results in the patient cohort are encouraging, warranting further investigation in larger Phase 2 studies.

8. Recommendations:
- Proceed with Phase 2 studies in various neuropathic pain conditions
- Explore extended-release formulation for potential once-daily dosing
- Conduct thorough QT study to further evaluate cardiovascular safety
- Investigate potential for drug-drug interactions, especially with common pain medications
- Consider mechanism of action studies to fully elucidate the role of specific sodium channel subtypes
