Case Title: Robert Green vs. PharmaCorp Case Number: 2022-CV-013
Date Filed: December 1, 2022 Court: Superior Court of Georgia Plaintiff: Robert Green Defendant: PharmaCorp
Procedural History: The trial court found probable cause to proceed with the lawsuit. The district court upheld this decision, and the case is currently pending.
Issue: The primary legal issue is whether PharmaCorp’s product, CholesterEx, caused muscle pain and whether PharmaCorp failed to provide adequate warnings.
Holding: The court found sufficient evidence to support the claim that the product caused muscle pain and that PharmaCorp failed to provide adequate warnings.
Rule: To establish a cause of action for failure to warn, the plaintiff must show that PharmaCorp knew or should have known about the risk of muscle pain and failed to provide adequate warnings.
Facts: The plaintiff, Robert Green, experienced muscle pain after using the product. Medical records documented the onset of pain shortly after starting CholesterEx, with expert testimonies indicating a likely link. Internal documents revealed PharmaCorp’s awareness of this risk, which was omitted from product warnings.
Reasoning: The court’s decision was based on medical records, expert testimonies, and internal PharmaCorp documents, demonstrating a strong link between the product and muscle pain. This omission was seen as a significant breach of PharmaCorp’s duty to consumers.
Analysis: The court focused on PharmaCorp's duty to warn consumers of known risks. Withholding warnings about muscle pain, despite internal awareness, constituted a breach of this duty. This omission was a substantial factor in the plaintiff’s injuries, meeting the requirement for probable cause.
Conclusion: The case was settled out of court, with PharmaCorp agreeing to pay $550,000 to the plaintiff and update product warnings to include muscle pain.
