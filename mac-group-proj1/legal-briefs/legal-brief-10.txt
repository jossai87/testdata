Case Title: Laura Martinez vs. PharmaCorp Case Number: 2022-CV-010
Date Filed: July 7, 2022 Court: Superior Court of Arizona Plaintiff: Laura Martinez Defendant: PharmaCorp
Procedural History: The trial court found probable cause to proceed with the lawsuit. The district court upheld this decision, and the case is currently pending.
Issue: The primary legal issue is whether PharmaCorp's product, DiabetAid, caused severe hypoglycemia and whether PharmaCorp failed to adequately warn about this risk.
Holding: The court found sufficient evidence to support the claim that the product caused severe hypoglycemia and that PharmaCorp failed to provide adequate warnings.
Rule: To establish a cause of action for failure to warn, the plaintiff must demonstrate that PharmaCorp knew or should have known about the risk and failed to provide adequate warnings.
Facts: The plaintiff, Laura Martinez, experienced severe hypoglycemia after using the product. Medical records documented multiple episodes of hypoglycemia shortly after starting DiabetAid, with expert testimonies supporting a likely link. Internal documents indicated that PharmaCorp was aware of this risk but chose to omit it from product warnings to avoid negative sales impact.
Reasoning: The court's decision relied on medical records, expert testimonies, and internal documents, showing a strong link between the product and hypoglycemia. Internal documents revealed PharmaCorp’s knowledge of this risk, which was omitted from consumer warnings. The court concluded that this failure to warn was a substantial factor in the plaintiff's condition.
Analysis: The court focused on PharmaCorp's duty to warn consumers of known risks. The omission of warnings about hypoglycemia, despite internal knowledge, constituted a breach of this duty and was deemed a significant factor in the plaintiff's injuries, satisfying probable cause.
Conclusion: The case was settled out of court, with PharmaCorp agreeing to pay $800,000 to the plaintiff and update warning labels to include hypoglycemia.
