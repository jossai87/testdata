Case Title: Richard Harris vs. PharmaCorp Case Number: 2023-CV-009
Date Filed: July 18, 2023 Court: Superior Court of Pennsylvania Plaintiff: Richard Harris Defendant: PharmaCorp
Procedural History: The trial court found probable cause to proceed with the lawsuit. The district court upheld this decision, and the case is currently pending.
Issue: The primary legal issue is whether PharmaCorp failed to warn about the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with their product, DiabetAid.
Holding: The court found sufficient evidence to support the claim that the product caused gastrointestinal bleeding.
Rule: To establish a cause of action for failure to warn, the plaintiff must demonstrate that PharmaCorp knew or should have known about the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and failed to provide adequate warnings.
Facts: The plaintiff, Richard Harris, experienced gastrointestinal bleeding after using the product. Medical records documented the onset of bleeding shortly after beginning DiabetAid, and expert testimonies suggested a likely connection. Internal documents indicated PharmaCorp was aware of this risk but chose to exclude it from warnings to prevent deterring customers.
Reasoning: The court’s decision relied on medical records, expert testimonies, and PharmaCorp’s internal documents. These sources supported a link between the product and gastrointestinal bleeding, while internal documents showed PharmaCorp’s decision to withhold this risk. The court concluded that the failure to warn was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's injury.
Analysis: The court’s analysis focused on PharmaCorp’s duty of care in informing consumers of known risks. The decision to withhold warnings about gastrointestinal bleeding constituted a breach of this duty. This omission was considered a major factor in the plaintiff’s injury, meeting the requirement for probable cause.
Conclusion: The case is pending, with the plaintiff seeking $800,000 in damages for failure to warn and resulting health complications.
