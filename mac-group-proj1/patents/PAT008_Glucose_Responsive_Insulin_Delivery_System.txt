Background of the Invention

The present invention relates to an advanced insulin delivery system that releases insulin in response to blood glucose levels, providing a dynamic approach to managing diabetes mellitus. Traditional insulin therapy often fails to mimic the body’s natural insulin response, requiring patients to rely on a fixed dosing schedule that cannot adjust to real-time glucose fluctuations. This approach increases the risk of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, especially in cases where physical activity, diet, or stre...

This glucose-responsive insulin delivery system addresses these challenges by releasing insulin only when blood glucose levels exceed a certain threshold. By tailoring insulin release based on glucose levels, this system offers a safer and more effective method for managing diabetes, reducing the risk of both high and low blood sugar events.

Summary of the Invention

The invention comprises a glucose-responsive insulin delivery system that autonomously releases insulin in response to elevated blood glucose levels. The system uses a glucose-sensitive hydrogel matrix embedded with insulin, which expands and releases insulin in proportion to glucose concentrations in the bloodstream. This glucose-responsive matrix is designed to sense changes in glucose levels and trigger insulin release when glucose levels rise above a predetermined threshold.

The system is formulated as an injectable depot, designed to reside in subcutaneous tissues where it can monitor and respond to glucose fluctuations. By adjusting insulin release in real-time, the system provides adaptive glucose control that more closely mimics the body’s natural insulin response.

Detailed Description of the Invention

The glucose-responsive insulin delivery system described in this invention is based on a hydrogel matrix that undergoes conformational changes in response to glucose levels. The hydrogel matrix is composed of biocompatible polymers, including poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and phenylboronic acid derivatives, which respond to glucose by altering their structure and releasing encapsulated insulin.

Upon exposure to high glucose levels, the phenylboronic acid components in the matrix bind to glucose molecules, causing the hydrogel to swell. This swelling effect triggers the release of insulin from the matrix, allowing it to enter the bloodstream. When glucose levels return to normal, the hydrogel contracts, slowing the release of insulin and minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia.

The formulation includes stabilizing agents to preserve insulin’s bioactivity within the hydrogel. The injectable depot forms a subcutaneous reservoir that continuously monitors blood glucose levels, ensuring a responsive and sustained insulin delivery over a period of days or weeks, depending on the dosage and formulation.

For patients requiring an extended-release system, this invention offers a biodegradable matrix that gradually dissolves over time, providing a long-lasting solution for diabetes management. The biodegradable nature of the matrix ensures that no residues remain in the body after insulin delivery is complete.

Experimental Data and Clinical Studies

In clinical trials, this glucose-responsive system demonstrated high efficacy in maintaining stable blood glucose levels. A 12-month study with 300 diabetic patients showed a 40% reduction in HbA1c levels compared to conventional insulin therapy. The glucose-responsive matrix enabled real-time insulin release, reducing episodes of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.

Pharmacokinetic data revealed that the system maintained effective plasma insulin concentrations that fluctuated in response to blood glucose levels, offering a more adaptive and physiologic approach to glucose control. Patient-reported outcomes indicated improved quality of life and reduced need for glucose monitoring, highlighting the convenience and effectiveness of the system.
