Background of the Invention

This invention relates to a cartilage regeneration stimulator designed to enhance cartilage repair and regeneration in individuals with degenerative joint diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the gradual breakdown of cartilage within the joints, leading to pain, inflammation, and reduced mobility. As cartilage serves as a cushion between bones, its degeneration exposes joint surfaces to wear, exacerbating joint deterioration and causing significant discomfort for patients.

Current treatments for joint degeneration focus primarily on pain relief and inflammation reduction, rather than on addressing the underlying cartilage degradation. While some experimental therapies aim to promote cartilage repair, they often lack specificity, are costly, or involve invasive procedures such as joint replacement. This invention addresses the need for a non-invasive, cost-effective approach that directly stimulates cartilage growth, offering a potentially curative therapy for joint ...
 
The cartilage regeneration stimulator in this invention selectively promotes the synthesis of cartilage extracellular matrix components, such as collagen and proteoglycans. By enhancing these structural elements, the compound restores cartilage integrity and function, improving joint health and patient mobility.

Summary of the Invention

The invention comprises a cartilage regeneration stimulator specifically formulated to target damaged joint tissues. The compound stimulates cellular processes that promote the synthesis of collagen and proteoglycans within cartilage, thereby regenerating damaged areas and enhancing the overall structural integrity of the joint. Additionally, the compound is formulated to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that are known to degrade cartilage tissue, thus providing a dual action of promotin...

This cartilage stimulator is delivered in a bioadhesive gel form, allowing it to adhere to joint surfaces and release the active compound gradually, ensuring prolonged exposure to the cartilage tissue. This sustained-release system maximizes efficacy, providing continuous stimulation for cartilage repair over extended periods with minimal systemic absorption.

Detailed Description of the Invention

The cartilage regeneration stimulator in this invention is a compound formulated to selectively enhance cartilage synthesis while inhibiting enzymes that break down cartilage. The active compound is a peptide-based structure designed to penetrate joint tissue and stimulate chondrocytesâ€”the cells responsible for cartilage synthesis. The peptide sequence is optimized for binding to cartilage cell receptors, initiating cellular pathways that increase collagen and proteoglycan production.

To prevent cartilage degradation, the compound includes a selective inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are often overactive in degenerative joint conditions. By reducing MMP activity, the compound helps preserve existing cartilage while promoting new growth, providing a comprehensive approach to joint repair.

The bioadhesive gel formulation contains biocompatible polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and sodium alginate, which allow the gel to adhere to the joint surfaces upon application. The formulation is further enriched with stabilizing agents, such as glycerin and antioxidants, to maintain the integrity and activity of the compound over extended periods. This formulation can be injected directly into the joint space, where it forms a thin layer that gradually releases the active ingredients.

For patients requiring systemic administration, the invention also includes an oral formulation. This formulation employs a controlled-release matrix composed of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), which enables the gradual release of the compound over 24 hours, maintaining effective plasma levels with a single daily dose.

Experimental Data and Clinical Studies

Clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of this cartilage stimulator in regenerating cartilage and improving joint function. In a randomized study with 500 osteoarthritis patients, those treated with the compound exhibited a 50% improvement in joint mobility scores compared to a placebo group. Pain scores were also significantly reduced, and MRI imaging showed visible increases in cartilage thickness in treated joints.

Pharmacokinetic data indicated that the bioadhesive gel maintained active compound concentrations within the joint for up to 72 hours post-application. The systemic controlled-release formulation achieved steady plasma levels, supporting a once-daily dosing regimen with minimal systemic side effects.

Claims

Claim 1: A cartilage regeneration stimulator comprising a peptide-based compound that promotes collagen and proteoglycan synthesis within cartilage tissue for joint repair.

Claim 2: The stimulator according to Claim 1, formulated in a bioadhesive gel for direct application to joint surfaces, allowing sustained release of the active compound.

Claim 3: The stimulator according to Claim 1, further comprising a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor to reduce cartilage degradation in degenerative joint conditions.

Claim 4: The method of treating degenerative joint diseases by applying the cartilage stimulator to promote cartilage synthesis and inhibit degradation.

Claim 5: The process for manufacturing a cartilage regeneration stimulator, including peptide formulation, bioadhesive gel preparation, and stabilization for joint therapy applications.

Conclusion

This cartilage regeneration stimulator offers a groundbreaking approach to treating degenerative joint diseases by enhancing cartilage synthesis and reducing degradation. Through its targeted action on joint tissues, the invention supports cartilage regeneration and improves joint function, providing patients with an effective, non-invasive alternative to current treatments. This innovation holds great potential for transforming the management of osteoarthritis and similar conditions, advancing joint health a...
