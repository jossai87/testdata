Background of the Invention

The present invention relates to a targeted receptor blocker for neurological applications, particularly in the management of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease, involve progressive deterioration of neurons and often lead to significant cognitive and motor impairments. These diseases pose substantial challenges for effective treatment, as conventional drugs lack the ability to target specific receptors in the brain, leading to undesirable side effects and limiting treatment efficacy.

Receptor blockers in the neurological field have shown promise in modulating brain pathways that may slow disease progression or alleviate symptoms. However, many receptor blockers are non-specific, meaning they act on a broad range of receptors, causing side effects such as dizziness, nausea, and other symptoms associated with disruption of non-targeted neural processes.

The innovation described in this patent addresses these limitations by introducing a highly selective neurological receptor blocker that minimizes off-target effects. By precisely binding only to pathological neural receptors, the invention maintains therapeutic effectiveness while avoiding interference with healthy neural pathways.

Summary of the Invention

This invention presents a targeted neurological receptor blocker designed for precision in treating neurodegenerative disorders. The compound selectively inhibits neural receptors linked to Alzheimer's Disease, minimizing activity on other receptors within the central nervous system. The selectivity of this receptor blocker is achieved through a unique molecular design, which allows it to bind only to receptors implicated in disease progression, while sparing normal functioning receptors. This invention thus provides a significant advantage in patient safety and tolerability.

The compound’s design incorporates an advanced ligand structure that recognizes specific receptor configurations associated with neurodegeneration, optimizing its pharmacodynamic profile. The invention is formulated as a once-daily oral tablet, ensuring a controlled release that maintains therapeutic concentrations over 24 hours. This feature improves patient adherence and reduces the risk of side effects.

Detailed Description of the Invention

The neurological receptor blocker described in this invention is based on a selective binding mechanism that differentiates between healthy and pathological receptors. This selectivity is achieved through a molecular scaffold that targets specific binding sites unique to receptors altered by neurodegeneration. The receptor blocker has a molecular weight optimized for blood-brain barrier penetration, allowing for effective transport to the brain without requiring invasive administration.

The active ingredient is encapsulated within a biodegradable matrix, which dissolves gradually to release the compound at a controlled rate. This controlled-release matrix is composed of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), both of which stabilize the compound and prevent premature degradation.

Upon administration, the receptor blocker achieves peak plasma concentration within two hours, with a half-life that supports a once-daily dosing schedule. The receptor blocker also includes stabilizing agents to prevent degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, ensuring that the active compound reaches the bloodstream intact. Once in the central nervous system, the receptor blocker binds specifically to targeted receptors involved in Alzheimer’s progression, mitigating the symptoms associated with neurodegeneration.

The invention covers both the compound itself and the manufacturing process, which includes microencapsulation, blending, compression, and enteric coating to improve stability and bioavailability. The enteric coating further protects the drug from premature release in acidic environments, directing it toward its absorption site in the intestines.

Experimental Data and Clinical Studies

In clinical studies, this receptor blocker demonstrated high specificity in binding to Alzheimer’s-related neural receptors, significantly reducing off-target effects. A controlled study with 300 patients over a 12-month period showed a 40% improvement in cognitive function scores compared to a placebo, with a statistically significant reduction in disease progression markers.

Safety evaluations indicated a 20% reduction in side effects typically associated with receptor blockers, such as dizziness and nausea. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the controlled-release formulation maintained stable plasma drug levels with minimal fluctuations, supporting the once-daily dosing regimen.

Claims

Claim 1: A pharmaceutical composition comprising a targeted neurological receptor blocker, characterized by its selective binding to pathological receptors associated with neurodegenerative disease.

Claim 2: The composition according to Claim 1, wherein the receptor blocker is formulated within a controlled-release matrix composed of polylactic-co-glycolic acid and polyethylene glycol.

Claim 3: The method of treating neurodegenerative diseases by administering the receptor blocker to achieve selective receptor inhibition and minimize off-target effects.

Claim 4: The process for manufacturing a targeted receptor blocker, including steps for microencapsulation, blending, compression, and enteric coating to ensure drug stability and bioavailability.

Conclusion

This invention represents a significant advancement in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by providing a targeted receptor blocker with minimized side effects and enhanced selectivity. By focusing on pathological receptors in the brain, the drug improves therapeutic outcomes for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease, enhancing their quality of life. This highly specific receptor blocker introduces a safer, more effective approach to managing neurodegeneration, aligning with the growing need for precision therapies in neurological health.
