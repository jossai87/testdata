Background of the Invention

This invention pertains to the field of anti-inflammatory compounds, specifically targeting joint-related conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Inflammatory joint diseases are characterized by chronic pain, stiffness, and progressive joint degeneration, severely impacting patient mobility and quality of life. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids are commonly prescribed to reduce inflammation and manage pain; however, their use is often limited by significant ...

Current NSAIDs, while effective, lack specificity and may inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, leading to adverse gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects. This invention addresses the need for a selective anti-inflammatory compound that targets joint inflammation without the systemic side effects associated with conventional treatments.

This novel anti-inflammatory compound provides a targeted approach to joint inflammation by specifically inhibiting the COX-2 enzyme, a primary mediator in inflammatory joint conditions. By offering a localized effect within joint tissues, this compound minimizes systemic absorption and associated side effects.

Summary of the Invention

The invention presents a selective COX-2 inhibitor formulated specifically for the treatment of joint inflammation. Unlike traditional anti-inflammatory drugs that act broadly across tissues, this compound selectively binds to COX-2 receptors in inflamed joint tissue, reducing inflammation and pain without inhibiting COX-1, which is crucial for gastrointestinal protection. The result is a highly effective treatment option that minimizes the risk of gastrointestinal damage and cardiovascular complications.

The compound is formulated as a topical gel and an oral tablet, offering flexibility in administration based on patient needs. The topical gel allows for direct application to affected joints, providing rapid relief without systemic exposure. The oral formulation, designed with a controlled-release matrix, ensures sustained action over a 24-hour period, improving patient adherence and comfort.

Detailed Description of the Invention

The anti-inflammatory compound described in this invention is a COX-2 selective inhibitor designed to target joint inflammation. The compound’s molecular structure is optimized to bind exclusively to COX-2 receptors, achieving an anti-inflammatory effect without affecting COX-1 receptors that protect the gastrointestinal lining. This specificity is achieved through a molecular scaffold incorporating a sulfonamide group, known for selective COX-2 inhibition.

For the topical gel formulation, the compound is embedded within a hydrogel matrix that allows gradual release upon application to the skin. The hydrogel is composed of biodegradable polymers, including poloxamer and carbomer, which enhance penetration into joint tissues while maintaining stability. This gel formulation is designed for application up to twice daily, providing localized anti-inflammatory effects with minimal systemic absorption.

The oral formulation employs a controlled-release delivery system based on hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and ethylcellulose. This system ensures that the drug is released gradually into the bloodstream, maintaining effective plasma concentrations over an extended period, and reducing the need for frequent dosing. The controlled-release matrix also minimizes peak plasma levels, lowering the risk of adverse effects commonly seen with immediate-release formulations.

In addition, the invention includes stabilizing agents and antioxidants that protect the compound from degradation, ensuring long-term stability and efficacy. The compound’s unique composition and delivery methods make it an ideal candidate for treating chronic joint conditions with a reduced risk of side effects.

Experimental Data and Clinical Studies

Clinical trials were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of this selective COX-2 inhibitor in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In a double-blind study with 400 participants, patients receiving the compound reported a 45% reduction in joint pain and stiffness compared to a placebo. Additionally, mobility scores improved significantly, and inflammation markers showed a substantial decrease.

Pharmacokinetic data from the trials revealed that the topical formulation achieved high drug concentrations within joint tissues, with negligible systemic absorption. The oral controlled-release formulation maintained steady plasma levels over 24 hours, aligning with once-daily dosing. Adverse effects were minimal, with no significant reports of gastrointestinal issues or cardiovascular complications, highlighting the compound’s improved safety profile over traditional NSAIDs.

Claims

Claim 1: An anti-inflammatory compound specifically targeting COX-2 receptors in joint tissues for the treatment of joint inflammation.

Claim 2: The compound according to Claim 1, formulated within a hydrogel matrix for topical application to achieve localized anti-inflammatory effects.

Claim 3: The compound according to Claim 1, delivered in a controlled-release oral tablet to maintain therapeutic plasma concentrations over 24 hours.

Claim 4: The method of treating joint inflammation by selectively inhibiting COX-2 receptors in joint tissues, minimizing systemic side effects.

Claim 5: The process for manufacturing the anti-inflammatory compound, including steps for hydrogel formulation, controlled-release matrix development, and stabilization to ensure consistency and efficacy.

Conclusion

The selective COX-2 inhibitor described in this patent represents a substantial advancement in the treatment of inflammatory joint diseases. By providing targeted anti-inflammatory action with minimal systemic effects, this compound enhances therapeutic outcomes and reduces patient risks associated with conventional NSAIDs. The innovation holds significant promise for improving joint health, mobility, and overall quality of life for individuals suffering from chronic inflammatory joint conditions.
